Stocks App

The app gives users 4 options to get, see, and analyze data on the stock of their choosing. 

The first thing users see when opening the app is an instructions page, simply detailing the features located under the "Work with Chosen Stocks" tab. 

The "View Online" tab allows users to search for a stock -- by ticker or by company name -- and then click a link to find the information on that stock on both the Motley Fool website and the Zacks website. 

The "Visualize with Graph" tab prompts users to input a date range to focus on for their selected stock and whether they would like to visualize the Open, High, Low, or Close price for the stock, or the Volume of trades for the stock each trading day in the selected data range. 

On the "See Historical Dividends" tab, users can select another date range from to examine the dividends paid by their selected stock. 

The final feature, the "Paper Trading Simulation" tab allows users to run their own simulation with up to 15 stocks of their choosing. They are prompted to select up to 15 stocks, then input how many shares of each stock they would purchase, then how many years they want to simulate. The simulation runs using the drift model to predict future performance of the portfolio and an "Important Message" box pops up with that predicted future value.
